## Developer Envrionment
All developers please use the virtual envrionment so that we all have the same development environment.
The library lists with version will be listed in a single requirement file so that they could be installed directly.

1. Code review is required before any merge/checkin.  
2. Coding standard is not a hard requirment, but please use readable naming rules.
### Using Virtual Envrionment
`` source tutorial-env/bin/activate ``
